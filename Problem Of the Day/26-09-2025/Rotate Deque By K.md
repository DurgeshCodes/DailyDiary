## üìå Problem Statement
You are given a deque¬†**dq**¬†(double-ended queue) containing non-negative integers, along with two positive integer¬†**type**¬†and¬†**k**. The task is to rotate the deque circularly by¬†**k**¬†positions.  
There are two types of rotation operations:

- **Right Rotation (Clockwise)**: If¬†**type = 1**, rotate the deque to the right. This means moving the last element to the front, and repeating the process k times.
- **Left Rotation (Anti-Clockwise)**: If¬†**type = 2**, rotate the deque to the left. This means moving the first element to the back, and repeating the process k times.

**Examples:**

**Input:** dq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], type = 1, k = 2
**Output:** [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]¬†
**Explanation:** The type is 1 and k is 2. So, we need to right rotate dequeue by 2 times.  
In first right rotation we get [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  
In second right rotation we get [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4].

**Input:** dq = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], type = 2, k = 3 
**Output:** [40, 50, 10, 20, 30]¬†
**Explanation:** The type is 2 and k is 3. So, we need to left rotate dequeue by 3 times.  
In first left rotation we get [20, 30, 40, 50, 10].   
In second left rotation we get [30, 40, 50, 10, 20].  
In third left rotation we get [40, 50, 10, 20, 30].

**Constraints:**  
1 ‚â§ dq.size() ‚â§ 105¬†1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 105¬†1 ‚â§ type ‚â§ 2
## üí° Approach
> Simply do what is asked. type one popright and pushleft.
> type2 popleft and push right.
> decrement k. 

## ‚è± Complexity
- Time: O(k)
- Space: O(1) 

## ‚úÖ Final Solution
```python
def rotateDeque(self, q, type, k):
        while k:
            curr = q.pop() if type == 1 else q.popleft()
            if type == 1:
                q.appendleft(curr)
            else:
                q.append(curr)
            k -= 1
```
