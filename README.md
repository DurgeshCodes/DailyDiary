# 📖 Daily Learning Diary

This repository serves as my **daily learning diary**, tracking:

1. **Coding Problems Solved** – LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and other platforms.
2. **System Design Articles / Case Studies** – Notes maintained in Obsidian.

The goal is to build **consistent habits**, reinforce learning, and maintain a **version-controlled knowledge base**.
